# Python CLI

CLI stands for "Command Line Interface" and it refers to a way of interacting with a computer program or system using text-based commands rather than a graphical user interface (GUI).

In the case of Python, the CLI refers to the Python interpreter, which is a program that reads and executes Python code. When you open a terminal or command prompt and type "python" or "python3" followed by the enter key, you will be presented with the Python CLI, which is also known as the Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop). This is the environment where you can enter Python code and see the results immediately.

The Python CLI can be used for a variety of tasks, including:

* Writing and testing small pieces of code
* Running Python scripts
* Interacting with the operating system
* Accessing the Python standard library and third-party libraries
* Debugging Python code
* Automating repetitive tasks

We can use the command `python hello.py` to run the hello world greeting program for python.
