# Apache Airflow

Apache Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It is an open-source workflow management system that allows you to define, schedule, and monitor workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks.

Airflow was developed to help users author, schedule, and monitor complex data pipelines. It provides a web-based interface for managing and monitoring the status of your workflows, and it also has a rich command-line interface for managing and triggering tasks.

Some of the key features of Airflow include:

* Support for scheduling and triggering tasks on a regular schedule
* Support for complex dependencies between tasks
* Support for retries and error handling
* Support for dynamic generation of tasks and workflows
* Support for parallel execution of tasks
* Support for monitoring and alerting on the status of tasks and workflows
* Support for extensibility, allowing users to create custom plugins and operators

Airflow is widely used in data engineering and data science to handle data pipelines and workflow management. It's used in various industries like healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and many more.

Airflow is built using Python and it's easy to integrate with other tools and frameworks used in data engineering and data science, like Spark, Hive, Presto and many more.

We can run the dag `hellow_world_dag` in any airflow environment.
