# Flask

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

Flask is a lightweight framework that is easy to learn and easy to use. It is designed to get you up and running quickly, without the need for complex configuration or boilerplate code. Flask does not have built-in support for things like forms and databases, but it is easy to add those features with popular third-party libraries like WTForms and SQLAlchemy.

The main features of Flask include:

* A lightweight and simple design
* Built-in development web server
* Support for routing (mapping URLs to Python functions)
* Support for template rendering
* Support for request handling
* Support for handling HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
* Support for request handling, with built-in support for cookies and file uploads
* Support for security features like cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection and password hashing

Flask is widely used to create web applications such as RESTful APIs, web dashboards, web services and many more. It's a great choice for small to medium-sized projects and for developers who want to get up and running quickly without having to learn a complex framework.

Make sure to change the directory to Django folder in your terminal before testing.
Run the `init.ps1` file for initial setup. We can use the following the command to run the development server locally:

`python hello.py`
